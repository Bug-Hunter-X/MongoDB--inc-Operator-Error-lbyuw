# MongoDB $inc Operator Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The issue arises from incorrect usage of the operator, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet shows an example of an update operation where the `$inc` operator is used improperly. The `$inc` operator is designed to increment or decrement a numerical field. If the field does not exist, `$inc` will create it with the given value, as opposed to creating a new field with the specified value.  The issue arises when handling scenarios where the field might not exist or is not an expected numeric type, leading to potential errors or unexpected outcomes.

## Bug Solution
The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle the `$inc` operator, ensuring that the operation is performed safely and correctly, regardless of the initial field state.
